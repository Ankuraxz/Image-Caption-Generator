Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a class of neural networks that is powerful for modeling sequence data such as time series or natural language.

Schematically, a RNN layer uses a for loop to iterate over the timesteps of a sequence, while maintaining an internal state that encodes information about the timesteps it has seen so far.
